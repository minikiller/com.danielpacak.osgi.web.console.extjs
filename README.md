## OSGi Web Console

The OSGI Web Console is a tool for inspecting and managing OSGi framework instances using a Web Browser.
It is very similar to the [Apache Felix Web Console][0] but is not exactly the same!

The Web UI is built with [Sencha Ext JS 4.1.x][1] and is supposed to be easily
extendable by developing various plug-ins.
