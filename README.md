OSGi Web Console
==========================
The OSGI Web Console is a tool for inspecting and managing OSGi framework instances using a Web Browser.
It is very similar to the Apache Felix Web Console (http://felix.apache.org/) but is not exactly the same!

The Web UI is built with Sencha Ext JS 4.1.x (http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and is supposed to be
extendable by developing plug-ins.
